    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>So it's come to this. You want a hot dog and you don't know how to make one, so you needed to look up a recipe. You should be ashamed of yourself, truly.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hot dogs (nobody makes their own hot dogs)</li>
        <li>Hot dog buns (optional, but strongly encouraged for the sake of not weirding out everyone around you)</li>
        <li>Whatever you want to put on the hot dog - there's literally no wrong choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil hot dogs<br>Note: You could also grill the hot dogs, but since you looked up a recipe for hot dogs it seems likely you don't know how to do that so let's not burn the house down</li>
        <li>If you're using a bun, put the warmed hot dog in the bun</li>
        <li>Smother the hot dog with whatever toppings you've selected until the hot dog is buried enough that maybe you'll forget you're eating a hot dog</li>
    </ol>
