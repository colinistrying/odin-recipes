    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Listen, I'm going to level with you. There's almost no way it's better to make hummus than to just buy it. There are so many people who make really good hummus, so why wouldn't you just buy theirs instead of making a worse version yourself? Life is hard enough without making your own hummus.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hummus (store bought)</li>
        <li>Pita chips (also store bought)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Open hummus and pita chip containers</li>
        <li>Remove pita chip from container</li>
        <li>Dip pita chip into hummus; shoot for gluttonous portion</li>
        <li>Insert heavily-hummused chip into your mouth</li>
        <li>Spend next two hours trying to decide what to watch on Netflix until you decide to just go to sleep with your stomach uncomfortably full of hummus and pita chips</li>
    </ol>
